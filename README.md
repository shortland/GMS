# GMS

My playground for querying & visualizing wallets & trades on from Loopring / GameStop Marketplace.

## Example

Historical trade price of an NFT

*(It's ugly, I just wanted to hack something quick together)*

![daily candlesticks of nft trades](README/example-price-history.png)

## Run locally

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
